# advanced-r
This R script performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on gene expression data, specifically analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and tumor samples. It uses three input files: Gene_Expression_Data.xlsx (raw gene expression data), Gene_Information.csv (gene-to-chromosome mapping), and Sample_Information.tsv (sample metadata with phenotypes). Required R libraries include readxl, readr, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, and pheatmap, which can be installed using install.packages(). The script generates visualizations like histograms, bar charts, heatmaps, and clustermaps to examine DEGs by chromosome, expression levels, and sample types, while also saving the results in a file, Significant_Genes.csv, with calculated statistics (e.g., log2 fold change, higher expression group). To run, place the files in the working directory, source the script, and view the outputs in the R plotting window or as the saved CSV file.
